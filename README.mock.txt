AI PODCAST CO-HOST (MOCK MODE)
==============================

The application is running in MOCK MODE due to missing dependencies.

To run the full application with all features:
1. Install all dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Make sure you have valid API key in .env file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

3. Run the application:
   python run.py

For now, you can view a simplified version by opening:
   app/static/index.html

processing or document understanding capabilities.
